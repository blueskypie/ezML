This package makes running machine models supported by the [caret
package](https://topepo.github.io/caret/) very easy. Basically users
only need to provide the name of the ML method and the rest are handled
automatically. More than 20 output files are produced covering various
stages of the process, including preprocessing, training, testing, and
inference.

See [manual](https://blueskypie.github.io/ezML/reference/index.html) and
[examples](https://blueskypie.github.io/ezML/articles/ezML-intro.html)

Since this is just a toy, I have no plan to submit it to CRAN. So please
install from github directly:

`devtools::install_github("blueskypie/ezML")`
