Description: This package makes running machine models supported by the 
    [caret package](https://topepo.github.io/caret/) very easy. Basically users only
    need to provide the name of the ML method and the rest are handled automatically.
    More than 20 output files are produced covering various stages of the process, 
    including preprocessing, training, testing, and inference.
